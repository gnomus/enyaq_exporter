# Prometheus exporter for Skoda vehicles

This Prometheus exporter connects to Skoda cloud services to receive vehicle metrics.

![build](https://github.com/chr4/enyaq_exporter/workflows/build/badge.svg)

It's currently retrieving the following values:

- Eletric vehicle range (`ev_range` value as integers).
- Eletric vehicle state of charge (`ev_soc` value as integers (percentages)).
- Vehicle status (`ev_status` return the charging state, see below for explanation).
- Charging finish time (`ev_finish_time` returns a UNIX timestamp, but in scientific notation.
- Odometer (`ev_odometer` returns the total distance travelled by the vehicle as integer).

It should work with all Skoda EVs, but is mainly tested with the Skoda Enyaq.

All the heavy lifting is done by [evcc libraries](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/).

## Explanation of vehicle status values

Below are the values of the `ev_status`-field and how they can be interpreted.

| Value| Plugged-in | Charging | Explanation                                                                                  |
|------|------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    0 |          ? |        ? | No status can be determined                                                                  |
|    1 |          N |        N | Car is not plugged-in                                                                        |
|    2 |          Y |        N | Car plugged-in but the vehicle is not charging                                               |
|    3 |          Y |        Y | Car plugged-in and is charging                                                               |
|    4 |          Y |        Y | Car plugged-in and charging, but with external ventilation request (for lead-acid batteries) |
|    5 |          Y |        N | Car plugged-in, but not charging due to error: cable error (CP short circuit, 0V)            |
|    6 |          Y |        N | Car plugged-in, but not charging. Simulate EVSE or unplugging error (CP wake-up, -12V)       |
